# AMATH741 - Numerical Partial Differential Equations: Project


* 'matlab' folder contains the matlab files to generate the data associated with PDE problems: Burgers and Korteweg-De Vries (kDV) equations. 

* The generated data for Burgers and kdV equations are stored in data folder. 

* The exact dynamics are plots for generated data. 



** The matlab file needs to install external programs called 'chebfun'. It can be installed via https://www.chebfun.org/download/ and it is compatiable with  MATLAB 7.9 (R2009b) or later**
